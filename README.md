# business-logic-local-dashboard

This dashboard runs inside the mock proxy server within a local Business Logic container.

Its goal is to provide a simple view into the aspects of BL that would normally communicate with Kinvey/the outside world -- namely collection access, email messages, push notifications, and logging. Additionally, it provides an easy way to import data into/export data from local collections and run simple operations on the database.
